 * This example illustrates a simple react project

 * Take note of the comments they point common
 * problems you will need to solve with React.
 *
 * There are two ideas here
 * - Input/Controlled Component Pattern
 * - Conditionally Rendering components
 *
 * The project has an input field where a user will
 * input a zip code. It finds weather data for that
 * zip and displays it in a component.
